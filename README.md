# BODY-FAT-PREDICTION
The aim of this analysis is to predict a persons body fat percentage from a feature set consisting of easy to obtain measurements. The motivation is that a sufficiently well-performing predictive model can serve as a cost effective alternative to more complex measurements to accurately measure body fat percentage. The data set also includes a feature “Density” which represents a persons body density measured through under water weighing. Density will be removed from the feature set used to build the predictive model. However, later I will construct a univariate linear model using only Density as a feature to compare its predictive performance to that of the model containing easy to obtain measurements.
